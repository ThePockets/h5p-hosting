Sometimes that program is called an *application* (or “app” for short). \n\nThere are different types of applications, or programs, that you can use to access the internet. You can think of them as different “brands” of internet programs, just like there are different brands of soups, shoes, spaghetti sauce, toys, and phones. \n\nThe different “brands” of internet are called *browsers*. Google Chrome is one type of browser; Internet Explorer is another, and Firefox is another one too. iPhone users have Safari as an internet browser, and a lot of computers have Microsoft Edge as an option. \n\nAll of the browser types are very similar, but each one has a few things that make them stand out. \n\nIn our class, we will use *Google Chrome* as our internet Browser. \n\nIf I say that it is time to &quot;close your browser,&quot; what I mean is that you should turn off your internet program."}
