Test - one piece for each letter. \n\nC stands for *Currency*. This helps you think about when the information was created, and helps you check to see if it has been updated. Usually *newer* information is better than older information.\n\nThe first A stands for *Accuracy*, which means how correct the information is. We make decisions based on information we learn, and so it is important that the information we read about is correct.\n\nThe second A stands for *Authority*, which helps you understand who created the information, and what their qualifications are. Someone can be an expert in one area and NOT an expert in another area, so it is important to know what makes someone qualified to talk about something. \n\nThe R in the C.A.A.R.P. Test stands for *Relevance*. This helps you think about whether or not the information matters to you. We can waste a lot of time and effort if we use information that doesn&#039;t matter to us!\n\nThe P in the C.A.A.R.P. Test stands for *Purpose*. This helps you think about why the information was created. Was it created to teach, sell, entertain, or persuade someone? Knowing *why* information was created is important!"}
